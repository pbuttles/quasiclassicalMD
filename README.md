# quasiclassicalMD
This is an animation of K. Dusling and  T. Schafer's derivation for a quasiclassical representation of the two-body potential between particles in a dilute fermi gas at unitarity. These potentials are the key driving force in the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation they developed to model behavior of this gas. Their paper can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.0....  

This animation was created using manim (mathematical animation), a free and open-source animation tool pioneered by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown fame, and further developed by the community the sprung up around it. More information, including downloads, can be found here: https://github.com/3b1b/manim.  

This animation was created for the UNC ViP Undergraduate Research Symposium Spring 2021, for which I presented our progress in Dr. Joaquin Drut's computational quantum matter lab, expanding on the work of the original paper.
